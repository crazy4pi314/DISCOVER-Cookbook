### During the event

#### Recommendations for participants

Suggestions listed here are most effectively demonstrated or discussed at the opening of each day of the event, but they can also be included in the registration packets or on web materials.

- One of the most frustrating and awkward experiences for event participants can be trying to join small group conversations. Especially given that networking can be one of the most beneficial outcomes of an event, it is important to make sure that all participants feel welcome to participate and join group conversations. It often is not the intent of those already in the group to exclude other participants but unconscious body language can communicate the group is closed. If participants make a concerted effort to leave open spaces in conversation groups it can greatly improve the overall participation of attendees in discussions. A good discussion of this effect and recommendations for the `Pac-man Rule' can be found here: [http://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/](http://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/)

#### Recommendations for session chairs/moderators

#### Social Events

- &quot;First-Time Attendee&quot; lunch/dinner/coffee-break as a welcome and safe place for attendees to ask questions.
- Consider diversifying the time of day that social events happen.
  - Not everyone is available (physically or mentally) in the evenings, when social events are typically concentrated.
- Alcohol Considerations
  - We recommend the AdaCamp Toolkit&#39;s summary approach to alcohol at events: [https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/)
